## Strengthening Studiz and their administration system by introducing a new digital solution  - room booking system
For my final thesis project, I decided to collaborate with Studiz and create a new addition to their system - a room booking functionality. 

Based on my research, and quoting my report 
>"The business offers a variety of products, including a website and a mobile app with similar functionalities and a student discount database in focus. To use the services, students have to create and verify a profile. [...] users from partnered educational institutionsgain access to the administration system, embedded within the website. [...] This system facilitates easier school management with diverse features, such as creating orders in canteen, purchasing tickets, signing up for study trips, or borrowing books from the library. Both students and faculty members can create their accounts, gaining access to functionalities in their profiles, which are directly connected to the administration system. The platform works as a bridge between students and teachers, creating a two-way flow of information. For partnered institutions, the student-ID ties the whole system together, providing users with access to all these features from their profiles." 

Due to the admin system being primarily a backend, I decided to code a Profile page, displaying already created bookings. Ideally, it "pulls" the information from the admin system and displays it on "booking cards". 

The cards work like an accordion, so - thanks to Java Script - they open with more detailed information inside.
